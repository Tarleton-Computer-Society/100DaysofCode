## Truffle

You'll first need to set-up the contract before we can continue.

To build and migrate the contract run the following:
```
$ cd solidity
$ truffle migrate
```

Once it has migrated make note of the contract's address. 

The output will look like this:
```
Using network 'development'.

```

You just need the part which says:

```
AddressBook: 0x897c95fed51d8b89a8a57d8bbe7f1522bf530571
```

In `public/src/scripts/controllers/addresses.js` paste this address on line 12 wrapped in quotes.

This will have also generated a directory called `build`. If you change the structure of the address book contract you will need to:
1. Inside `solidity/build/contracts/AddressBook.json` there is a json structure, at the first level there is an "abi" object
2. Copy the entire value of this abi into `public/src/scripts/contracts/addressbook.json` 

## Node

Now you've set-up Truffle we can build the web application. 

The first thing we will need to do is get grunt installed by running:

```
$ cd public
$ npm update
$ grunt
```

This will build, minify and serve the application at http://localhost:8000
