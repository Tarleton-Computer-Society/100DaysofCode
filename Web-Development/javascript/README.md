Javascript is an excellent language for  web development and more. T. According to a study published in the [_European Journal of Social Psychology_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674), it takes 66 days on average to start a new habit. The technical fields change extremely rapidly; therefore, it is critical to form the habit of continual learning if you wish to succeed as a programmer. Good luck on your learning journey.

## Rules

1. The exercise is segmented in to seven modules that each span 2 weeks. You should expect to spend _One Hour_ each day on average.

2. Get into the practice of commenting your code to explain the expected output or function. ( A programmer writes code computer understands,A good programmer writes code people understands)
