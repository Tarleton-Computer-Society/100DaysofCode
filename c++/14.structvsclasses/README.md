# Struct vs classes

A class is private by default.
However with struct it is default set to public.

struct was given in c++ just foe backward compatibility.

SO people generally use this struct when we have just some data.

When we are not using inheritence then struct can be used very easily.

Technically there is no difference between them rather than the above stated.
