# Welcome to C++

## 1. Its a native language , very close to hardware and fast

<br>

## 2. C# or java run on a virtul machine -> first compile to intermediate language -> to that platform compatable.(we can take the analogy of a book written in english with translator where a german person can use that translator to read that book , but in case of c++ the book comes automatically for different languages)

<br>

## 3. C++ produces direct code for that platform i/e the native code

<br>

## 4. But the thing is if we write bad code in c++ then it will be slower than other language as well

<br>

## 5. Tensorflow, gameengines are purely written in c++

<br>

## 6. We need a text editor to write a c++ code -> compiler -> executable binay. So we need a compiler to the minimum point.(So for this we can use microsoft visual studio IDE which comes with all plugins-- make sure to install desktopdevelopment with c++ while installing visual studio)

## 7. BUILD -> will directly convert tobinary and produce the exe file which can be run directly.

# C++ Introduction

## 1. Low level Programming

## 2. Speed of execution

## 3. Derived From c

## 4. Richer library from C

## 5. Supports OOPS

## 6. Generic programming ( also suports error handling)

<br>

# We generally use this where we have less memory or less power
