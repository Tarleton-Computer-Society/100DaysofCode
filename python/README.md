# 100 Days of Python



Python is an excellent language for software development, web development, automation, data engineering, data analytics, data science, and more. T. According to a study published in the [_European Journal of Social Psychology_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674), it takes 66 days on average to start a new habit. The technical fields change extremely rapidly; therefore, it is critical to form the habit of continual learning if you wish to succeed as a programmer. Good luck on your learning journey.

## Rules
1. Use these [GitHub instructions](../master/git.md) to learn how to fork the GitHub repo into your own account and how to add git functionality with your IDE.
2. The exercise is segmented in to seven modules that each span 2 weeks. You should expect to spend _One Hour_ each day on average.
3. At the conclusion of each day, modify the [log file](../master/log.md) with the topic, completion date, and what you learned.
4. Upload any created during the day's exercise with the format: **_moduleX\_dayX\_topic.py_** for python scripts or **_moduleX\_dayX\_topic.ipynb_** for Jupyter Notebook files
5. Get into the practice of commenting your code to explain the expected output or function.
